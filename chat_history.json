Here are the key changes:\n\n### 1. **Updated commonStyles.ts**\n- Enhanced the common text styles to ensure all text defaults to white (`colors.text: '#ffffff'`)\n- Added additional text style variants (heading, subheading, body, caption, label) all using white text\n- Changed the default card background from `colors.cardLight` (white) to `colors.card` (dark blue) so white text is visible\n\n### 2. **Fixed Text Colors in All Screens**\nUpdated the following files to use consistent white text:\n\n- **Profile Screen** (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`)\n- **Applications Screen** (`app/applications.tsx`) \n- **Home Screen** (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`)\n- **Calendar Screen** (`app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`)\n- **Roster Screen** (`app/(tabs)/roster.tsx`)\n\n### 3. **Key Changes Made**\n- Changed all card backgrounds from white (`colors.cardLight`) to dark blue (`colors.card`)\n- Updated all text colors that were using `colors.background` (dark blue) to `colors.text` (white)\n- Fixed calendar theme colors to use white text on dark backgrounds\n- Updated filter buttons and badges to use white text\n- Ensured stat cards, info cards, and all UI elements use white text consistently\n\n### 4. **Maintained Visual Hierarchy**\n- Primary text: White (`colors.text`)\n- Secondary text: Light gray (`colors.textSecondary`) \n- All text is now easily readable against the dark blue background theme\n\nThe app now has consistent white text throughout all screens while maintaining the professional blue theme and excellent readability. All text elements including headings, body text, labels, buttons, cards, and navigation elements now use white text that contrasts well with the dark blue background."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "7c434af7885538e74d5be1a166f7a91afd5ea32c", "message": "style: Ensure all text is consistently white throughout the app\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T00:29:35Z", "files_changed": [], "update_number": 11, "parent_commit_id": "405c0a08caa9090ee5298db741aa01cedc92fc48"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-04T00:23:38Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "make a tab for messaging for all explorers and individual explorers   "}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will add a messaging tab to the app. This tab will include:\n\n1.

I have successfully added a return to home icon to your Daytona Beach Police Explorer mobile app. Here's a summary of what I implemented:\n\n## Return to Home Icon Implementation\n\nI added a **home icon** (house.fill) to the headers of all major screens in your app that aren't the home screen itself. The home icon appears as a blue button in the top-left corner of each screen's header.\n\n### Screens Updated:\n\n1. **Applications Screen** (`app/applications.tsx`)\n   - Added home icon to the custom header\n\n2. **New Application Screen** (`app/new-application.tsx`)\n   - Added home icon alongside the back button in the header left area\n\n3. **Application Details Screen** (`app/application-details.tsx`)\n   - Added home icon alongside the back button in the header left area\n\n4. **Event Details Screen** (`app/event-details.tsx`)\n   - Added home icon alongside the back button in the header left area\n\n5. **All Tab Screens**:\n   - **Calendar** (`app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`)\n   - **Roster** (`app/(tabs)/roster.tsx`)\n   - **Meetings** (`app/(tabs)/meetings.tsx`)\n   - **Community Service** (`app/(tabs)/community-service.tsx`)\n   - **Photos** (`app/(tabs)/photos.tsx`)\n   - **Messages** (`app/(tabs)/messages.tsx`)\n   - **Profile** (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`)\n\n### Key Features:\n\n- **Consistent Design**: The home icon uses a blue background (`colors.primary`) with white icon color for good contrast against the light blue app background\n- **Easy Navigation**: Users can quickly return to the home screen from any part of the app with a single tap\n- **Proper Routing**: All home icons navigate to `'/(tabs)/(home)'` which is your main home screen\n- **Visual Consistency**: The home icon styling matches the app's design language with rounded corners and proper padding\n\n### Icon Styling:\n- **Icon**: `house.fill` (filled house icon)\n- **Size**: 20px\n- **Background**: Blue (`colors.primary`)\n- **Color**: Black text (`colors.text`)\n- **Shape**: Rounded rectangle with 6px border radius\n- **Padding**: 6px for comfortable touch target\n\nNow users can easily navigate back to the home screen from anywhere in the app by tapping the home icon in the header! The icon provides a quick and intuitive way to return to the main navigation menu and overview of the Daytona Beach Police Explorer program."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "f8df46d71a9895f8ab7dfa92b0b61c84860560e4", "message": "feat: Add home icon to headers for easy navigation\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T05:31:53Z", "files_changed": [], "update_number": 36, "parent_commit_id": "7e1b427aa8da335e1fae82b72a25d486610dffcb"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-04T05:27:07Z"}]
