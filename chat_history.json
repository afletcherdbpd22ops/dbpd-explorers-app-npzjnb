Here are the key changes:\n\n### 1. **Updated commonStyles.ts**\n- Enhanced the common text styles to ensure all text defaults to white (`colors.text: '#ffffff'`)\n- Added additional text style variants (heading, subheading, body, caption, label) all using white text\n- Changed the default card background from `colors.cardLight` (white) to `colors.card` (dark blue) so white text is visible\n\n### 2. **Fixed Text Colors in All Screens**\nUpdated the following files to use consistent white text:\n\n- **Profile Screen** (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`)\n- **Applications Screen** (`app/applications.tsx`) \n- **Home Screen** (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`)\n- **Calendar Screen** (`app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`)\n- **Roster Screen** (`app/(tabs)/roster.tsx`)\n\n### 3. **Key Changes Made**\n- Changed all card backgrounds from white (`colors.cardLight`) to dark blue (`colors.card`)\n- Updated all text colors that were using `colors.background` (dark blue) to `colors.text` (white)\n- Fixed calendar theme colors to use white text on dark backgrounds\n- Updated filter buttons and badges to use white text\n- Ensured stat cards, info cards, and all UI elements use white text consistently\n\n### 4. **Maintained Visual Hierarchy**\n- Primary text: White (`colors.text`)\n- Secondary text: Light gray (`colors.textSecondary`) \n- All text is now easily readable against the dark blue background theme\n\nThe app now has consistent white text throughout all screens while maintaining the professional blue theme and excellent readability. All text elements including headings, body text, labels, buttons, cards, and navigation elements now use white text that contrasts well with the dark blue background."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "7c434af7885538e74d5be1a166f7a91afd5ea32c", "message": "style: Ensure all text is consistently white throughout the app\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T00:29:35Z", "files_changed": [], "update_number": 11, "parent_commit_id": "405c0a08caa9090ee5298db741aa01cedc92fc48"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-04T00:23:38Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "make a tab for messaging for all explorers and individual explorers   "}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will add a messaging tab to the app. This tab will include:\n\n1.
